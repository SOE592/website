## Goals for today

* Outline the steps to a data science analysis

> - Understand the software requirements for the course


## Credits

This content draws upon material developed by Jeff Leek & Roger Peng for their Advanced Data Science Course at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.


## Steps to an analysis

1. Define the question  
2. Get the data  
3. Clean the data  
4. Explore the data  
5. Fit statistical models  
6. Communicate the results

6. Communicate the results  

**Make your analysis reproducible!**


## Steps to an analysis | 1. Define the question of interest  

What makes a good Q?

> - It should be specific  
> - It should be answerable with available data
> - It should come with a definition of success  
> - It should not be designed to discriminate or cause harm


## Steps to an analysis | 2. Get the data  

Data sources (in order of confidence):

> - You collected your own  
> - Collaborators  
> - Public repositories


## Steps to an analysis | 3. Clean the data  

This is usually the most time intensive step

It's also the most important & the hardest to teach

## Steps to an analysis | 4. Explore the data  

Do the data meet your expectations?

> - Make judicious use of plots

> - Also consider correlation matrics (eg, [{corrplot}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html))

> - Beware of data mining!


## Steps to an analysis | 5. Fit statistical models  

Where to start?

> - Start with first principles

> - Keep it simple


## Steps to an analysis | 6. Communicate the results  

Who's your audience? What's your medium?

> - Lab group

> - Social media, blog posts

> - Presentation

> - Publication


## Steps to an analysis | Make your analysis reproducible  

Consider these real scenarios

> - "Can you re-run the analysis with these new data?"

> - "Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you donâ€™t reply to emails" (Karl Broman)


## Types of analysis | Raw

The goal is to explore the data 

This is your "sandbox"


## Types of analysis | Informal

Soften the edges of the raw results

> - Focus the analysis ("refine the arc")

> - Improve the presentation

> - Narrow your conclusions

## Types of analysis | Formal

A refined analysis and presentation

> - Code in supplementary materials (**GitHub**, **Zenodo**, **figshare**)

> - High quality figures


## A rubric for analyses

Here are some useful questions to ask yourself


## A rubric | Answering the question

> - Could the question be answered with the available data?

> - Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific application?

> - Did you record the experimental design?


## A rubric | Cleaning the data

> - Are the data "tidy"?

> - Did you record the recipe for moving from raw to tidy data?

> - Did you record all parameters, units, and functions applied to the data?


## A rubric | Exploratory analysis

> - Did you make univariate plots (histograms, density plots, boxplots)?

> - Did you consider correlations between variables (scatterplots)?

> - Did you check the units of all data points to make sure they are in the right range?

> - Did you try to identify any errors or miscoding of variables?


## A rubric | Statistical analysis

> - Did you identify the quantities of interest in your model?

> - How did you select your model(s) (eg, information theory, cross validation)?

> - Is this a correlative or causative study?


## A rubric | Communication

> - Did you describe the data set, experimental design, and question you are answering?

> - Did you specify the model you are fitting?

> - Does each table/figure communicate an important piece of information?


## A rubric | Reproducibility

> - Did you create a script that reproduces all your analyses?

> - Did you save the raw and processed versions of your data?

> - Did you record all versions of the software you used to process the data?

> - Did you try to have someone else run your analysis code?


# Software requirements


## Software in this course

Is free

Is well supported by the user community


## R Software | An environment for statistical computing and graphics

> - Enormous developer & support communities

> - [Learn more here](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)


## R packages

Most of R's current capabilities come from *packages*

> - We'll use a variety of them for many different tasks

> - We'll also learn how to create our own!


## RStudio | An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

> - Syntax highlighting, code completion, smart indentation  

> - Easily manage multiple working directories using projects  

> - Extensive package development tools  

> - Built-in tools & GUIs for **Git** & **R Markdown**


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/RStudio_desktop.png data-background-size=cover}


## RStudio benefits

### [Cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

<br>

### [Webinars, links, etc](https://resources.rstudio.com/)


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/RStudio_cheatsheet.png data-background-size=cover}


## GitHub | Cloud-based code repository & collaboration platform

> - Store, manage, track changes to code

> - Communicate with other team members

> - Uses **Git** for version control


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/gh_signup.png data-background-size=100%}


## &nbsp; {data-background=images/GitHub_repo.png data-background-size=100%}


## Git | Version control system (VCS)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/about) records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later


## PostgreSQL | Open source relational database system

> - Uses & extends the SQL language

> - Highly extensible (eg, define your own data types)

> - Active user community


## R Markdown

Notebook interface to weave together text, equations, and code into nicely formatted output

Allows you to create and document fully reproducible workflows


## R Markdown

Supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats

* HTML  
* PDF  
* MS Word  
* HTML5 slides  
* Books  
* Shiny apps  
* Scientific articles  
* websites

## What's next?

We'll learn about research compendia and style conventions for coding and naming
