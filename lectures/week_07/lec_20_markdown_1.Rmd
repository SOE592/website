# Background

Writing documents in **R Markdown** is relatively straightforward once you know [some of the basics](intro_rmarkdown.html). You can create many different formats, including `.pdf`, `.html`, and `.doc`, and customize them in a variety of ways.


***

# Templates

There are a number of existing templates available in the [**rticles**](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package that you can use for knitting your document to a specific style in `.pdf` format. For `.html` formats, there are a variety of "themes" [available as well](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/). For example, this document was created with the `spacelab` theme.

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Open RStudio and from the menu options select **File > New File > R Markdown...**
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** You can change the **Title**, **Author**, and **Date**, fields here, but we'll do that later.
</div>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_create_new.png")
```

<br>

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Leave the **Default Output Format** as `HTML` and click on **OK**.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-success boxy-check">
**Success:** You now have a new `.Rmd` file ready for editing, which includes some placeholder text and code blocks.
</div>

# Document layout

## Front Matter (YAML)

Every Markdown document begins with a section of plain text written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) ("YAML Ain't Markup Language"). This block of human readable code is used to define some of the document's metadata such as the title, author, and date. It is also used to specify the document's format (eg, HTML or pdf) and its layout (eg, theme, font).

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** The front matter is defined in a block of text that begins and ends with 3 dashes `---`.
</div>

Here is the YAML for our new simple HTML document:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Mark Scheuerell"
date: "10 February 2023"
output: html_document
---
```

The YAML can include a lot more information as well, including fields for various pre-defined themes, a table of contents, adding citations and formatting references, and whether to use other files as formatting templates. For example, here is the YAML for this document with today's class notes:

```
---
title: "Using R Markdown for publications"
subtitle: "Part 1"
date: "10 February 2023"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: spacelab
    highlight: textmate
    css: ["lecture_inst.css", "fontawesome.css", "solid.css"]
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    toc_depth: 3
bibliography: "references.bib"
csl: "ecology.csl"
---
```

# Knitting your file

The process of creating a nicely formatted document (e.g., `html`, `.pdf`) from the raw markdown code in the `.Rmd` file is known as _knitting_. You can knit a `.Rmd` file from the R command line, but the easiest way in RStudio is to simply click the **Knit** button at the top of the editing pane.

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** Clicking on the downarrow to the right of the **Knit** button brings up some additional options.
</div>

![](images/rmd_knit_options.png)

<br>

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Click on the **Knit** button to render your `.Rmd` file as a `.html` file.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** Knitting a `.Rmd` file automatically saves it. The first time you click **Knit**, you will be prompted for the filename and location where you want to save the file.
</div>

![](images/rmd_html_knitted_1.png)

<div class="boxy boxy-success boxy-check">
**Success:** You now have a knitted `.html` file.
</div>

## Make some changes

Let's make some changes to our markdown document and knit them.

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Add a title, subtitle, and table of contents (toc) to the YAML.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** The indentation and colons in the YAML subfields are necessary.
</div>

</div>

![](images/gh_new_repo_pages_done.png)

## Create an RStudio project

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Create a new project in RStudio from the `markdown-demo` repo you just created.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Open a new R Markdown document and give it a title. Select the **HTML** format and click **OK** when you're done.
</div>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_html_doc_new.png")
```

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Save your new document in a new subfolder within your `markdown-demo` project called `docs` with the filename `index.Rmd`.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** When you click **Save**, your markdown document will be knit automatically.
</div>

![](images/rmd_html_doc_save.png)

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** You should now see a `/docs` folder in the RStudio file pane. Click on it and you will see your `index.Rmd` and `index.html` files there. 
</div>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_html_index_1.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_html_index_2.png")
```

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Commit your changes to the `index.Rmd` and `index.html` files.
</div>

![](images/rmd_html_index_commit.png)

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Push your commit when done.
</div>

![](images/rmd_html_index_push.png)

## Viewing your document

Now that we've pushed our basic HTML report to GitHub, we should be able to view it online.

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Navigate back your `markdown-demo` repo on GitHub and you'll see the `/docs` folder containing the `index.Rmd` and `index.html` files you just pushed.
</div>

![](images/gh_repo_updated.png)

![](images/gh_repo_docs.png)

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** If you click on the `index.html` file, you'll notice that it just displays the raw HTML code rather than a nicely formatted website.
</div>

![](images/gh_repo_docs_index.png)

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** GitHub cannot render HTML files in a normal repo, but you can view your new document by navigating to `https://USERNAME.github.io/markdown-demo/` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username.
</div>

![](images/gh_pages_rendered.png)

<div class="boxy boxy-success boxy-check">
**Success:** You now have an online report that you can update by making changes in your RStudio project and pushing them to GitHub.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
