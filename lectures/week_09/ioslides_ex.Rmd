Some content without a title

## Adding code

```{r simple_code, echo = TRUE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
a / b
```


## Adding hidden code

```{r simple_code_2, echo = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
a / b
```


## Adding code that doesn't evaluate

```{r simple_code_3, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
a / b
```


## Highlighting code

The third line of code appears in bold

Press `h` to make the non-bold lines fade away

```{r simple_code_4, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
a <- 1
b <- 2
### <b>
a / b
### </b>
```


## Adding plots

```{r plot_cars, fig.cap="A simple scatterplot", echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```


## Adding plots

```{r plot_cars_2, fig.cap="A simple scatterplot", echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
plot(cars)
```

## Adding equations

A standalone equation

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

An inline equation where $\epsilon_i \sim \text{N}(0, \sigma^2)$


## {data-background=img/rmarkdown.png data-background-size=cover}


## A smaller, off-centered image {data-background=img/rmarkdown.png data-background-size="50%" data-background-position="0% 50%"}


## Smaller code block {.smaller}

```{r small_code, echo = TRUE}
## a simple regression model
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
## model summary
summary(fit)
```

## {.flexbox .vcenter}

### Some centered content

</div>

## A slide with colored text

<div class="red2">
This text is red
</div>

<div class="blue">
