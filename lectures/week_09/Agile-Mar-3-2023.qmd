## Today's Plan {style="\"position:absolute;" top="20;" left="0"}

-   A Kaizen (aka continuous improvement) group game!
-   Learn about the core ideas of "lean" and "Agile" for team projects
-   Intro to the basics of Scrum Sprints
-   Demo of Scrum Sprint on GitHub project boards

## What is agile?

A **lightweight** workflow **structure** for software development which is characterized by 4 key features.

Term is traced back to the 2001 [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), but the ideas are much earlier and broader. Very related to Lean Methodology (aka Toyota Way).

## Four elements {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/agile-elements.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Breaking work into chunks
-   Reflection and planning after each chunk
-   Radically anti-hierarchical team structure
-   Regular facetime
-   Respect for the individual (learning focus)
-   Early and regular end-user feedback
:::

## Iterative Cycles

A key principle: dividing work into 10-30 day chunks with plan and review (or check) elements

## Self-organizing teams {.smaller}

<hr>

Adopt habits that organically improve team flow and efficiency.

### Task boards

-   visualize your workflow
-   team awareness
-   encourages cycles of work
-   helps team not waste time on unimportant things
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Facetime

-   short daily check-ins, aka "stand-ups"
-   co-working, group or often paired
:::

## Task boards

## Why use a task board? {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/Kanban_board_example.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   team awareness fundamentally changes the team dynamic

-   forces work to be iterative and incremental

-   helps team define a minimally complete chunk of work that can be reviewed

-   quickly reveals bottlenecks and barriers
:::
:::

## Keeping the task board up to date {.smaller}

Keeping the team task board fresh won't happen by itself. Everyone get pulled into their own rabbit hole and then team becomes silo-ed.

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Daily Standup**

:::

::: {.column style="border:4px solid black; padding: 10px; width: 40%;"}

time-boxed 15 minutes

what I did yesterday, what I plan to do today, any barriers

a designated team facilitator runs this

done around the task board

can be done asynchronously but much better if it is live

gets the team in flow

## Scrum

Most popular and widely used method in software development, but not restricted to software at all.

![](images/scrum-cycle.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Formalizes the workflow cycles and events

## Scrum Roles and Artifacts {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Roles**

-   **Product Owner**: Job is to decide what the group is doing and curate the backlog of tasks
-   **Scrum master**: Facilitator and coach the team
-   **Developers**: Do the tasks
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Artifacts**

-   **Backlog**: All the planned tasks in various stages of ready
-   **Sprint Backlog**: Things to be completed in current sprint
-   **Product Increment**: What you will complete in this sprint. Needs to be something you can demo or present
:::
:::

## Sprint Cycle {.smaller}

**Product Owner** Works on the backlog and gets tasks ready for next sprint.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Scrum Master**

-   Day 1: **Facilitates** planning mtg
-   Day 8-28:
    -   **Runs** daily standups.
    -   **Helps** team members with barriers
    -   **Works with** product owner
-   Last day: **Facilitate** Retrospective meeting
:::

::: {.column style="width: 50%; color: blue"}
**Team**

-   Day 1: **Sprint Planning**
-   Day 8-28: **Work on tasks** with daily standups
-   2 days before end of sprint: **Sprint Review** Show work to "customer"<sup>1</sup>
-   Last day: **Retrospective** Team reflects on how their process of work did and picks one thing to do better

1 In a science context, this might be a presentation outside of the team. Formal enough that you need to do a good job.

## I left out some big parts of Scrum {.smaller}

### This is a Lean/Agile/Kaizen approach

-   radically anti-hierarchical team structure
-   importance of intentionality
-   rethinking of human agency within team structures
-   radical candor and authenticity within teams

### Velocity

Scrum in software dev is used to speed up development cycles. Velocity and measuring the size of tasks is a key part of Scrum in this context.
