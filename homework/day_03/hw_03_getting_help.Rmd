# Getting help

This assignment will allow you to demonstrate that you can create a minimal, reproducible example (reprex) in a quest for help.

# Task 1

Navigate to the **Pisaster** repo [here](https://github.com/FISH549/pisaster) and fork it to your own **GitHub** account.

# Task 2

Create a new **RStudio** project from your forked copy of the **Pisaster** repo.

# Task 3

Open up the script `01_summary_statistics.R` and run all of the code. The last line of code will issue a warning and if you inspect the value of `mean_count`, you will (perhaps unexpectedly) find a peculiar result.

# Task 4

Assume that you do not understand the source of the warning and resulting value for `mean_count` (and it's OK if you don't). Create a [new Gist](https://gist.github.com/) that asks for help in resolving the error. Make sure to

* Give your Gist a meaningful description

* In the box that says "Filename including extension...", enter `problem_with_mean.md`, which will allow you to use Markdown to mix text and code in the body of the message below just as you would with a repo's `README.md` file.

* In the body of the Gist, include *all of the information that someone would need to assist you* without the need to load additional files, navigate elsewhere, etc.

**Hint**: You can denote R code in Markdown documents in 1 of 2 ways:

1. For a single line of code, enclose the statement with a single back-tick (\`) like \``a <- 1`\`

2. For a block of code, enclose the statements with three back-ticks (\`\`\`) like

````
```
a <- 1
b <- 2
a / b
```
````

* When you are finished typing all of your information, click on the green **Create secret gist** button.

Note that you can make edits to a Gist after you've created it by clicking on the **Edit** button in the upper right.

# Task 5

After you've created your new Gist with your request for help and a reprex, create a new issue in your `fish549` repo that you worked on for [Assignment #1](https://fish549.github.io/website/homework/week_01/hw_01_github_remotes.html). Give the issue an informative title and include a short description of your problem. Copy/paste the URL for the Gist into the issue description, and assign the issue to Mark. (Note that the Gist URL should look something like `https://gist.github.com/USERNAME/59376e6f58a97d08f068edb015286891` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub user name and the alpha-numeric sequence is unique to you.)
