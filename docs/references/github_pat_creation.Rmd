# Personal Access Token (PAT)

Personal access tokens (PATs) are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub application programming interface (API) or the command line. Personal access tokens are intended to access GitHub resources on your behalf and **should never be shared with anyone else**.

***

# Generating a PAT

Generating a PAT from within GitHub is relatively straightforward; there are two different ways shown below to access the settings. Once upon a time, PATs never expired, but now for security reasons there are options to have them expire after a set period of time, which you can set.

## PAT via GitHub

You can navigate directly to the tokens page in GitHub via https://github.com/settings/tokens.

Alternatively, you can click through the following sequences from your profile page on GitHub.

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Click on your profile pic (or default avatar) and select **Settings**.

## PAT via `{usethis}`

You can also generate a PAT directly from within R by using the `{usethis}` package.

<br>

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** If you do not already have the `{usethis}` package installed, you will need to do so. Copy the code below, paste it into the R console, and run it.
</div>

```{r install_usethis, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("usethis")) {
  install.packages("usethis")
}
```

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Use `usethis::create_github_token()` to open up the new tokens on GitHub.
</div>

**Input**

```{r create_token, eval = FALSE}
> usethis::create_github_token()
```

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** Executing the above R command will respond with the following message and automatically open a new token page in GitHub specified by the URL. 
</div>

**Output**

```{r create_token_response, eval = FALSE}
• Call `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` to register this token in the local Git credential store
  It is also a great idea to store this token in any password-management software that you use
✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,user,gist,workflow&description=DESCRIBE THE TOKEN\'S USE CASE'
```

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">

</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">

# Store your PAT

Now that you've generated a PAT and have copied it to the clipboard, you need to store it for later use when interacting with GitHub via RStudio or the command line.

If you use a third-party password manager (e.g., **1Password**), you might want to add your new PAT to the entry for GitHub, where presumably you've already stored your username and password when you created your account.

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** If you misplace your PAT or it doesn't seem to be working, go ahead and [generate a new one](#generating-a-pat).
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** If you set an expiration date for your PAT (e.g., 60 days), you might want to set a calendar reminder to generate a new one in the future, so as to avoid the potential head-scratching problem of not being able to push commits to GitHub.
</div>

## Using `{gitcreds}`

The [`{gitcreds}`](https://r-lib.github.io/gitcreds/) package was created specifically for reading and writing Git credentials from within R. It will have been installed along with the `{usethis}` package.

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** Before proceeding, make sure you have created a PAT and copied it to the clipboard.
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-blue boxy-clipboard-list">
**Task:** Use `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` to store your PAT. At the prompt, paste your newly created PAT and press 'return' ('enter') when you are ready.
</div>

**Input**

```{r set_gitcreds, eval = FALSE}
> gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** The pasted PAT in the example below is `ghp_` followed by a string of `x`'s; your PAT will look different.
</div>

**Output**

```{r paste_gitcreds, eval = FALSE}
? Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-> Adding new credentials...
-> Removing credentials from cache...
-> Done.
```

<div class="boxy boxy-red boxy-exclamation">
**Note:** If you already have a stored PAT, `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` will respond with the following information. `[your-user-name]` will be your GitHub username. 
</div>

```{r gitcreds_already_set, eval = FALSE}
-> Your current credentials for 'https://github.com':
  protocol: https
  host    : github.com
  username: [your-user-name]
  password: <-- hidden -->

-> What would you like to do? 

1: Keep these credentials
2: Replace these credentials
3: See the password / token

Selection: 2
-> Removing current credentials...
? Enter new password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
-> Adding new credentials...
-> Removing credentials from cache...
-> Done.
```

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** If you have reason to believe your PAT was compromised or it's simply expired, first create a new one using the steps in this guide, and then select option `2: Replace these credentials` when calling `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`. 
</div>

<div class="boxy boxy-orange boxy-lightbulb">
**Tip:** You can check that you've stored a credential with `gitcreds::gitcreds_get()`.
</div>
